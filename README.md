- **Speed Distribution by Direction**: Dual charts showing vehicle speed distributions for each direction, helping identify speeding patterns
- **Speed Compliance Analysis**: Compares compliant vs. non-compliant vehicles by direction using green/red color coding
- **Speeding Patterns by Hour**: Dual-axis charts combining total vehicle count with speeding percentage to optimize enforcement timing

#### üöõ Vehicle Classification

#### üìñ Interactive Chart Explanations

Each visualization includes an expandable "See explanation" section that provides:

- **How to read this chart**: Step-by-step guidance for interpreting the visualization
- **Key patterns to look for**: Important indicators and what they mean
- **Practical applications**: How to use the data for traffic management decisions
- **Color coding explanations**: What different colors and elements represent

### Usage Examples

```python
# Standard enhanced loading with validation
df, location, structure = load_data('traffic_data.csv')

# Access filtering statistics
stats = structure['filtering_stats']
print(f"Removed {stats['removed_rows']} inactive periods ({stats['removal_percentage']:.1f}%)")

# Check data quality
quality = structure['data_quality']
if not quality['is_valid']:
    print(f"Data validation errors: {quality['errors']}")

# Memory-efficient loading for large files
df, location, structure = load_large_traffic_data('large_file.csv', chunk_size=10000)

# Monitor memory usage
memory_info = get_memory_usage(df)
print(f"Dataset using {memory_info['total_memory']} of memory")
```
